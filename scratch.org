#+STARTUP: showall

* Brainstorming

SimpleWidget should grant its abilities via COMPOSITION, not INHERITANCE
- It should be an EXTENSION, not a COMPONENT
- EXTENSIONS should act like COMPONENTs but also provide a HOOK interface
- 

Transition hook attributes should instead be explicit DOUBLE BUFFER objects
- Finalize
- Flip
- On transition
- Initial value

What if you need to keep SimpleWidget's rect identical to its parent's rect?
What if you don't?
