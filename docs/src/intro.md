# Introduction

**hgf** is a hierarchical GUI framework for Python, built on top of Pygame. It is designed to ease the creation of graphical applications that,

- **Support external configuration** - controls, options, style
- **Separate major concerns** - behavior, layout, appearance
- **Manage structural complexity** - by combining basic components

This book documents hgf version 0.1.1, which is pre-alpha. Anything can change, but the above three principles will remain constant.
